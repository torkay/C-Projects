## Lesson 2:
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Area and Perimeter Calculator
        ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** The code is a C# program that calculates the area and perimeter of a shape. The user is asked to provide the width and length of the shape, and then is given a choice of whether to find the area, perimeter, or both. If the user enters an invalid input, they are prompted to try again. The program has the ability to reset and repeat the calculation.

  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Temperature Converter
      ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This program allows the user to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user will first be prompted to specify which type of conversion they want to perform (Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa). Then, they will enter the temperature they want to convert. The result will be displayed and the user will be asked if they want to perform another conversion. If they answer "yes", they will be taken back to the beginning of the program and be able to start the process over again. If they answer "no", the program will end.
      ‚Ä¢ **Lines of code:** 70

  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 3: Math Quiz Game
      ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This code implements a simple console-based math quiz game that generates random arithmetic problems and evaluates the player's answers. The game has 4 questions on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with randomly generated numbers between 1 and 12. If the player's answer is correct, their score is incremented by 1. At the end of the game, the player's score is displayed and the player has the option to play again. If the player enters an invalid response, the program prompts them to try again.

## Lesson 3
  ‚û°Ô∏è 'Program.cs' Launchpad Application
      ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This program is a simple console-based menu system that provides access to different examples of C# code. It starts by checking if the user has entered the correct password through a separate class, and if the password is correct, it gives the user the option to access three different examples of code through a menu-based system, or to exit. The examples are simple C# programs that demonstrate different aspects of the language, such as while loops, for loops, and nested for loops.

    ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: For Loop 'Lesson3_1-FoExample.cs'
        ‚Ä¢ Brief: This code is a simple example of the implementation of the "for loop" in C#. The class "forExample" demonstrates three different uses of the "for loop", printing out the values of "i" each time the loop runs. The first loop counts from 0 to 10, the second counts down from 20 to 0 by 2s, and the last counts from 0 to 100 by 5s.
        ‚Ä¢ Lines of code: 34

    ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: While Loop 'Lesson3_2-WhileExample.cs'
        ‚Ä¢ Brief: This project contains a class called "countToTen" that uses a while loop to count from 0 to 10 and from 20 to 0 by decrements of 2. The numbers are displayed on the console using Console.Write(). The while loop continues to execute until the condition in the parentheses is false.
        ‚Ä¢ Lines of code: 27

    ‚û°Ô∏è Project 3: Password Authentication System 'PasswordCheck.cs'
        ‚Ä¢ Brief: This project implements a password authentication system, which allows the user to enter a password to gain access to the system. The password is checked using the "SuccessfulEntry" method, which returns a boolean value indicating if the password entered is correct. The user has three attempts to enter the password before the system returns "Attempt limit reached". If the password is incorrect, the number of attempts made is displayed. If the password is correct, the method returns "Successful Attempt".

    ‚û°Ô∏è Project 4: Nested For Loop 'NestedForLoops.cs'
        ‚Ä¢ Brief: This project demonstrates the use of nested for loops to create multiplication tables. The nestedForLoops class contains a constructor that uses two for loops, the outer loop iterates 10 times and the inner loop iterates 10 times. The outer loop is used to determine the number to be multiplied and the inner loop is used to iterate over the numbers to be multiplied by. The result of the multiplication is printed to the console.
        ‚Ä¢ **Lines of code:** 19

    ‚û°Ô∏è Project 5: Method 'Lesson3_5-MethodExample.cs'
        ‚Ä¢ Brief: This project demonstrates the usage of methods in C# by creating a class called "methodExample". The class contains four methods for basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. The class' constructor calls these methods, passing the values 1000 and 500 as arguments, and prints the results of these operations to the console. The project showcases how methods can be used to perform repetitive tasks and make code more readable and maintainable.
        ‚Ä¢ Lines of code: 43

    ‚û°Ô∏è Project 6: User Input Validation 'Lesson3_6-UserInputCheck.cs'
        ‚Ä¢ Brief: The project demonstrates the implementation of user input validation in C# using the Console.ReadLine() method. The program prompts the user for input and uses a combination of the long.TryParse() method and a while loop to validate if the input is a number. The program also implements a function that validates if the user's input is either "yes" or "no". The user input is used to determine the program's next course of action.

    ‚û°Ô∏è Project 7: FizzBuzz 'Lesson3_7-FizzBuzz.cs'
        ‚Ä¢ Brief: This project is about implementing the "Fizz Buzz" game in C# language. The game is simple. For numbers from 1 to 100, it will print the number, but if the number is divisible by 3, it will print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, it will print "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it will print "Fizz Buzz". This project is a simple implementation of "Fizz Buzz" game using for loop and modulo operator.

## Lesson 3.5 (Class Tutorials)
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Reverse Guessing Game 'Tutorial1_0'
      ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** The computer guesses a random number between 1 and 100 in this reverse guessing game. The player then indicates whether the guess is too high or too low. The game will continue until the program guesses correctly. If the player tells the computer that the guess is too high, the computer must remember not to guess any higher. If the player complains that the guess is too low, the computer must remember not to make any lower guesses. Furthermore, the machine will determine whether or not the player cheated and did not enter result.
